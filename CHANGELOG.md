## Release Notes

### v1.0.0 - What's New?

This is my first open-source release! I've been using Echo across a few personal projects and decided it was time to clean it up and share it.

**What I've used it for:**
- Testing microservice interactions without running everything locally
- Debugging issues by replaying specific scenarios
- Speeding up development by avoiding service startup time

I'm sharing this in case it's useful to others who face similar problems!

### Upgrade Notes

If you've been using a previous personal version, configuration remains backward compatible.
